### Rails Inventory Management System (RIMS).

RIMS is an Open Source Inventory Management System designed primarily to keep track of electronic parts and components. It will allow you to keep track of your available parts and assist you with re-ordering parts.

### Project Status
This project is currently in an early alpha stage. Code quality is improving constantly. However, this project is not ready for production yet.

### Installation

`bundle install`

`rake db:create && rake db:migrate && rake db:seed`

`rails s`

This will install all the gem dependencies for you, create a local database, run the database migrations and seed the database with some default items. It will also create an admin and a regular user for you to login as. The credentials for this user are:

**Admin User**
```
username: sheikhhussnain23@gmail.com
password: admin
```
**Regular User**
```
username: 13054119-147@uog.edu.pk
password: changeme
```

If you want to run unit tests you can do so by running the following command:

`bundle exec rspec spec/`

***You might receive an error when trying to upload an image to RIMS. If so make sure you have installed imagemagick.***

Using Homebrew on OSX it's as easy as: `brew install imagemagick`

### Pagination
Pagination is set at 5 items per page. This can be changed in `app/models/item.rb` just look for the line that says: `self.per_page = 5` and change it to whatever number of items you'd like it to be.
